    <h2>Lux trams</h2>
    <p>The tramway's entry into service has brought many changes to public transport services in Luxembourg City. With the extension of the line and its future offshoots, the tramway continues to revolutionize transport in and around Luxembourg's capital. Like all public transport in Luxembourg, the tramway is free to use.Luxembourg is in the process of reintroducing trams to its transport infrastructure. Construction work began on a new tram depot on the edge of the Gr√ºnewald Forest and the Kirchberg quarter of Luxembourg City in January 2015,[1] with the first tracks of the T1 tramline being laid in July 2016.[2] The tramline, when fully operational, will have 24 stations connected by 16 km (9.9 mi) of tracks and have a capacity of 10,000 passengers per hour in each direction.[3] Trams provided by the Spanish company CAF[4] began trials on the first phase of the route in July 2017.</p>
